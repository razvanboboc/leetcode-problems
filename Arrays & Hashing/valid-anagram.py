# https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/
# Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        counter = {}

        for char in s:
            counter[char] = counter.get(char, 0) + 1

        for char in t:
            if char not in counter or counter[char] == 0:
                return False
            counter[char] -= 1
        
        return True
